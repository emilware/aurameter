# aurameter
this is a repository for anyone that wants to make an "aurameter" with an arduino uno

**Description**
There are different sketches for different sensors and functions. Each one does the same thing, measure distance, convert that to "aura" and allow you to make it higher or lower with user input. Requirements, including components are shown in the respective folder's wireup diagram.

*Any issues?*
Please tell me them!
